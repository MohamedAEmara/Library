# Library

This is a Web page of a library. 

Every book has the following properties:

    -Title
    -Author
    -Number of Pages
    -Date of Publishing
    -Status (read or not)

You can **Add** new books, **Delete** books, and **Change the state** of every book 
whether it's read or not yet.

You have a global counter of **Read**, **Not read**, and **Total** number of books.
